This manual guides you through using the Walmart Sales Forecasting System, a two-application solution for predicting weekly sales trends.

\section{What is the Walmart Sales Forecasting System?}

The system consists of two complementary applications:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Training App}: Runs locally on your computer to train forecasting models
	\item \textbf{Prediction App}: Accessible online to generate 4-week sales trend forecasts
\end{itemize}

\section{Understanding Sales Forecasts}

\subsection{What the System Predicts}
The system generates 4-week forecasts of \textbf{week-over-week sales changes}, not absolute sales values. This means:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Each prediction shows how much sales will change compared to the previous week
	\item Positive values indicate sales increases
	\item Negative values indicate sales decreases
	\item Values are in dollar amounts (change from previous week)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example Interpretation:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Week 1: +1,200 = Sales increased by \$1,200 from last week
	\item Week 2: -500 = Sales decreased by \$500 from Week 1
	\item Week 3: +300 = Sales increased by \$300 from Week 2
	\item Week 4: +800 = Sales increased by \$800 from Week 3
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Note}
The system uses "differenced" data for model training and prediction:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Raw sales data is converted to week-to-week differences
	\item This transformation improves forecast accuracy
	\item Predictions represent these differences, not absolute sales values
\end{itemize}

\section{Purpose and Benefits}

This system enables:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Understanding weekly sales trends and patterns
	\item Identifying periods of sales growth or decline
	\item Making informed inventory and staffing decisions
	\item Comparing performance of different forecasting models
\end{itemize}

\section{Target Audience}

This manual is designed for:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Business analysts tracking sales trends
	\item Store managers planning inventory changes
	\item Data analysts working with time series data
	\item Anyone needing to understand sales change patterns
\end{itemize}

\section{Quick Start Overview}

The typical workflow involves:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Setting up the Training App on your local computer
	\item Uploading historical sales data and training models
	\item Saving trained models
	\item Accessing the online Prediction App
	\item Loading models to generate 4-week trend forecasts
	\item Interpreting weekly sales changes from predictions
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
	\item System overview and architecture
	\item Local Training App setup and usage
	\item Cloud-based Prediction App usage
	\item Data requirements and formats
